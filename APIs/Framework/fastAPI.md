# FastAPI
- Purpose: A modern, fast, and asynchronous API framework built on Python with automatic documentation.
- When to Use: When you want a lightweight, high-speed alternative to Django REST Framework.
- Real-time Example: If you want to create an optimized backend for RGU-Blogs with fast API responses and async support.
- Faster than Django REST Framework.
- Built-in data validation with Pydantic.
- Asynchronous support for better performance.
- FastAPI is a framework that helps you build APIs, but it primarily supports REST APIs and WebSocket APIs.
- FastAPI is best when you need fast, async REST APIs. It belongs under REST APIs, but itâ€™s just a better tool to build them.
